For this project, I have created multiple pages of a Twitter copy cat-like application. This is a front-end project. There is a login, tweet page, and profile page that is accessible, in dark mode, with error messages if passwords are inserted with acceptable characters. The goal is to develop a web application replicating core functionalities of Twitter(X).The process of creating a replica was just using the real Twitter(X) as a reference and trying to replicate it on my own. The End result is a project that exercises primarily HTML and CSS  to complete and finish this product.
